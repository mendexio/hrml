# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

HRML is an open source project that welcomes everyone. We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for all contributors, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Standards

**Expected behaviour:**

- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Accept feedback gracefully and give it kindly
- Focus on what's best for the project and the web
- Respect that people have different communication styles and needs

**Unacceptable behaviour:**

- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Trolling or deliberately disruptive behaviour
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Async-First Communication

HRML is maintained through asynchronous communication. This means:

- All project communication happens through GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions
- There are no required calls, meetings, or real-time chat
- Response times vary - this is normal and expected
- Written communication is the standard - be clear, be patient

This is by design, not by limitation.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces: the repository, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other channel where you represent HRML.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the project maintainer at the email listed on [mendex.io](https://mendex.io). All reports will be reviewed and will result in a response appropriate to the circumstances.

The maintainer has the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviour deemed inappropriate or harmful.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
